
        1 )  How  do the  declarations  look in  the  GIMPLE? Specifically,  what
            happens to multiple  variables declared and initialized  on the same
            line? What happens to global declaration [int Z]?


int Z;                                                                                                   |main ()
                                                                                                         |{
        void main()                                                                                      |  int a;
        {                                                                                                |  int b;
                int a, b, c;                                                                             |  int c;

                                                                                                         |
                a = 10;                                                                                  |  p = 6;

                p = 6;                                                                                   |  _1 = a * b;

                r = 34.5;                                                                                |  p = 6;
                Z = r;                                                                                   |  q = Z;
                Z = Z + 1;                                                                               |  r = 3.45e+1;
        }                                                                                                |  _2 = (int) r;
                                                                                                         |  Z = _2;
                                                                                                         |  Z.0_3 = Z;
                                                                                                         |  _4 = Z.0_3 + 1;
                                                                                                         |  Z = _4;
                                                                                                         |}
                                                                                                         |                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                         
          
           Ans - i) The program is initiated by declaration of variables each one on the different  line.
                 ii) even though variables of same datatype are declared on same line, the gimple file  contains  each variable on different line.
                 iii)global variable isn't declared at start . It is used directly into the operations.


      
           2   How are complex  expressions such as [c  = a * b +  25] broken down?
               Can you  determine a  rule as  to when  temporary variables  will be
               introduced?

           Ans- i)complex operations are broken down into two or more simpler steps.when there are more than one operators other than the assignment operator ,
                  temporary variables are used in order to make the operation more simpler. With help of these variables , 
                  operation is splitted into simple steps.Value of splitted operation is stored into these variables.
                  in given example , there are two operators * and+.so here  temporary variables come into the picture.       




           3    How are  floats/doubles represented in  GIMPLE? What happens  when a
                float/double is assigned to an integer in [Z = r]?
           Ans- type conversions are used to convert float/double to int datatype explicitly.
                Floats/doubles are denoted using scientific notations.



           4    How  are reads/writes  to the  global variable  Z performed?  Why is
                there a temporary introduced  for the statement [Z = Z  + 1] but not
                for the statements [q = Z] or [Z = p]?

           Ans- A temporary  variable is required for Z = Z + 1 because the result of the computation Z + 1 cannot
                be written directly to a memory location.In case of q=Z we can write Z value in variable q.
